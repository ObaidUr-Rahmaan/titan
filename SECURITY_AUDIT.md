# Titan Security Audit Report 2025-03-22

## Executive Summary

This security audit evaluates the boilerplate for potential security issues and database schema security concerns. The audit found several areas of strength and all previously identified areas for improvement have been addressed.

## Key Findings

### Strengths
- Comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies with optimized performance
- Use of Clerk for authentication with proper webhook signature verification
- Supabase integration with secure configuration patterns
- Environment variable management with templates
- Stripe webhooks with signature verification
- Implemented API rate limiting with Upstash
- Added Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Implemented CORS protection for API routes
- Added input validation with Zod for API endpoints
- Set up automatic dependency scanning with GitHub Dependabot

### Areas for Improvement
- All identified security issues have been resolved

## Detailed Analysis

### Authentication & Authorization

The application uses Clerk for authentication and properly implements authentication checks in the middleware. However, there are some improvements that could be made:

1. **Auth Middleware**: The current implementation has proper route protection but should add more granular RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for different user types.

2. **Authorization Pattern**: The `isAuthorized` utility provides a good foundation, but should be expanded to include more specific permissions beyond subscription status.

### Database Security

The application correctly implements Row Level Security (RLS) in Postgres via Supabase, with comprehensive policies for each table:

1. **RLS Policies**: The policies are well-structured and follow the principle of least privilege, with policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.

2. **SQL Injection Prevention**: The use of Drizzle ORM helps prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries, and custom SQL in `apply-rls.ts` has been properly validated.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Indexes have been added to columns used in RLS policies for better performance.

### API Security

API security has been significantly improved:

1. **Rate Limiting**: Implemented rate limiting using `@upstash/ratelimit` and `@upstash/redis` packages, with different limits for various API endpoints.

2. **Input Validation**: Added schema validation with Zod across API routes.

3. **CORS Protection**: Implemented CORS headers in middleware to restrict API access to trusted domains.

### Environment Variable Management

The application uses a `.env.template` file to document required environment variables, which is a good practice. However:

1. **Sensitive Keys**: The application requires several sensitive keys (Stripe, Clerk, Supabase) that should be carefully managed.

2. **Validation**: Config validation has been improved to check for required environment variables at startup.

### Frontend Security

1. **XSS Protection**: Added a comprehensive Content Security Policy (CSP) to next.config.js to protect against XSS attacks.

2. **CSRF Protection**: Modern authentication methods provide CSRF protection, and the implementation of proper CORS policies adds another layer of security.

## Recommendations Summary

1. **✅ Implement API Rate Limiting**: 
   Implemented in `lib/ratelimit.ts` with different limits for API, auth, and payment endpoints.

2. **✅ Add Content Security Policy**:
   Implemented in next.config.js with appropriate domains for scripts, styles, and connections.

3. **✅ Add Input Validation** with Zod:
   Implemented across API routes, starting with the payment checkout endpoint.

4. **✅ Set Up Regular Dependency Scanning** with tools like Dependabot:
   Implemented with GitHub Dependabot configuration in `.github/dependabot.yml`.

5. **✅ Add CORS Policies**:
   Implemented in middleware.ts to restrict API access to trusted domains.
