# Security Audit Report - Titan SaaS Template

## Executive Summary

This security audit evaluates the Titan SaaS template repository for potential security issues, recommended hosting configurations, and database schema security concerns. The audit found several areas of strength and some areas for improvement.

## Key Findings

### Strengths
- Comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies with optimized performance
- Use of Clerk for authentication with proper webhook signature verification
- Supabase integration with secure configuration patterns
- Environment variable management with templates
- Stripe webhooks with signature verification

### Areas for Improvement
- Lack of API rate limiting despite dependencies being included
- Missing CSP (Content Security Policy) implementation
- Limited input validation
- Missing CORS policy configuration

## Detailed Analysis

### Authentication & Authorization

The application uses Clerk for authentication and properly implements authentication checks in the middleware. However, there are some improvements that could be made:

1. **Auth Middleware**: The current implementation has proper route protection but should add more granular RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for different user types.

2. **Authorization Pattern**: The `isAuthorized` utility provides a good foundation, but should be expanded to include more specific permissions beyond subscription status.

### Database Security

The application correctly implements Row Level Security (RLS) in Postgres via Supabase, with policies for each table:

1. **RLS Policies**: The policies are well-structured and follow the principle of least privilege, but lack policies for INSERT, DELETE operations on most tables.

2. **SQL Injection Prevention**: The use of Drizzle ORM helps prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries, but custom SQL in `apply-rls.ts` could benefit from additional validation.

3. **Index Recommendation**: Following RLS best practices, indexes should be added for columns used in RLS policies for better performance.

### API Security

Several API security concerns were identified:

1. **Rate Limiting**: Despite including the `@upstash/ratelimit` and `@upstash/redis` packages, no actual rate limiting implementation was found. This leaves the API vulnerable to brute force attacks and DoS.

2. **Input Validation**: Limited use of schema validation with Zod was observed, but not consistently across all API routes.

### Environment Variable Management

The application uses a `.env.template` file to document required environment variables, which is a good practice. However:

1. **Sensitive Keys**: The application requires several sensitive keys (Stripe, Clerk, Supabase) that should be carefully managed.

2. **Validation**: There's no validation for required environment variables at startup.

### Frontend Security

1. **XSS Protection**: React provides some inherent XSS protection, but there's no explicit CSP (Content Security Policy) implementation.

2. **CSRF Protection**: No explicit CSRF protection was found, though modern authentication methods may mitigate this.

## Hosting Recommendations

### Cloudflare vs Vercel

**Recommendation**: Consider using Cloudflare in front of Vercel for enhanced security.

#### Benefits of Cloudflare:
- **DDoS Protection**: Cloudflare offers enterprise-grade DDoS protection
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**: Helps protect against common vulnerabilities
- **Bot Management**: Protection against malicious bots
- **Caching**: Edge caching can improve performance and reduce origin server load
- **Cost Efficiency**: Cloudflare's free tier offers significant protection 

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Deploy to Vercel** as you normally would
2. **Set up Cloudflare**:
   - Create a Cloudflare account
   - Add your domain to Cloudflare
   - Update your nameservers to Cloudflare's
   - Set DNS records to point to your Vercel deployment
   - Configure SSL/TLS to "Full" or "Full (strict)"

3. **Configure Security Settings**:
   - Enable Bot Fight Mode
   - Set appropriate WAF rules
   - Configure rate limiting rules
   - Set up Page Rules for caching

4. **Cost Comparison**:
   - Vercel Pro: $20/month (team)
   - Cloudflare Free Tier: $0/month (provides DDoS protection, basic WAF)
   - Cloudflare Pro: $20/month (advanced security features)

Using Cloudflare in front of Vercel provides better security against DDoS and other attacks while potentially reducing Vercel bandwidth costs.

## Recommendations Summary

1. **Implement API Rate Limiting**:
   ```typescript
   // Create a new file: lib/ratelimit.ts
   import { Ratelimit } from "@upstash/ratelimit";
   import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";

   // Create a new ratelimiter that allows 10 requests per 10 seconds
   export const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
     redis: Redis.fromEnv(),
     limiter: Ratelimit.slidingWindow(10, "10 s"),
   });
   
   // Then in your API routes:
   // const { success, limit, reset, remaining } = await ratelimit.limit(
   //   request.ip ?? "anonymous"
   // );
   // if (!success) {
   //   return new Response("Too Many Requests", { status: 429 });
   // }
   ```

2. **Add Content Security Policy**:
   Create a CSP in next.config.js or as HTTP headers.

3. **Add Input Validation** with Zod across all API routes.

4. **Set Up Regular Dependency Scanning** with tools like Dependabot.

5. **Add CORS Policies** to restrict API access to trusted domains.
