## üß≠ Navigation System Tests

### 1. Organization-Aware Routing Structure
**Test Routes:**
- [ ] `/org/[orgSlug]/dashboard` - Organization overview
- [ ] `/org/[orgSlug]/members` - Team management  
- [ ] `/org/[orgSlug]/projects` - Project management
- [ ] `/org/[orgSlug]/billing` - Billing & subscriptions
- [ ] `/org/[orgSlug]/settings` - Organization settings

**Expected Behavior:**
- Organization slug validation in layout
- Server-side organization membership verification
- Context provider setup with real-time organization data

### 2. Enhanced Organization Switcher
**Features to Test:**
- [ ] **Smart Routing**: Maintains sub-route context when switching organizations
- [ ] **Quick Actions Dropdown**: 
  - Dashboard (‚åòD), Settings (‚åòS), Members (‚åòM)
  - Projects (‚åòP), Billing (‚åòB)
- [ ] **Recent Organizations**: localStorage tracking and display
- [ ] **Role Indicators**: Crown/User/Shield icons based on membership role
- [ ] **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during organization switches

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Switch between organizations while on `/org/org1/members` ‚Üí Should go to `/org/org2/members`
2. Use keyboard shortcuts for quick actions
3. Verify recent organizations persist across browser sessions
4. Check role badges display correctly for different membership levels

### 3. Context-Aware Sidebar Navigation
**Features to Test:**
- [ ] **Personal Context**: Shows individual dashboard links when not in organization
- [ ] **Organization Context**: Shows organization-scoped navigation with role display
- [ ] **Dynamic Switching**: Sidebar updates automatically based on current route context
- [ ] **Role Display**: Shows current user's role in organization

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Navigate from `/dashboard` to `/org/[orgSlug]/dashboard` - sidebar should switch contexts
2. Verify correct navigation items show for each context
3. Check role display accuracy in organization context

### 4. Navigation Breadcrumb System
**Features to Test:**
- [ ] **Context Indication**: Shows current context (Personal vs Organization name)
- [ ] **Quick Context Switching**: 
  - "Switch to Personal" button in organization context
  - "Switch to Organization" when in personal context
- [ ] **Current Route Display**: Shows current sub-route with proper icons
- [ ] **Direct Navigation**: Click breadcrumb items to navigate

## üõ°Ô∏è Route Guards & Security Tests

### 5. Server-Side Route Protection
**Guard Functions to Test:**
- [ ] `guardOrganizationRoute()` - Comprehensive organization access validation
- [ ] `guardDashboardRoute()` - Basic auth and trial validation  
- [ ] `guardOrganizationAdminRoute()` - Admin-only routes
- [ ] `guardOrganizationBillingRoute()` - Billing manager+ routes

**Test Scenarios:**
1. **Authentication**: Unauthenticated access should redirect to `/sign-in`
2. **Trial Status**: Expired trial should redirect to `/trial-expired`
3. **Organization Membership**: Non-members should be denied access
4. **Role Validation**: Non-admins should be blocked from admin routes
5. **Billing Access**: Non-billing managers should be denied billing routes

### 6. Client-Side Access Control
**Hooks to Test:**
- [ ] `useOrganizationGuard()` - Real-time access control
- [ ] `useOrganizationAdminGuard()` - Admin-only components
- [ ] `useOrganizationBillingGuard()` - Billing access control

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Role-based UI hiding/showing
2. Real-time permission updates when role changes
3. Loading states during permission checks
4. Access denied UI components

### 7. Middleware Integration
**Middleware Tests:**
- [ ] **Organization Route Detection**: `/org/*` pattern matching
- [ ] **Slug Validation**: Invalid slugs handled properly
- [ ] **Trial Checks**: Applied to organization routes
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful redirects with error context

## üîÑ State Management Tests

### 8. Organization Provider Context
**State Management Features:**
- [ ] **Organization Data**: Members, permissions, preferences, stats
- [ ] **Real-time Updates**: Integration with Clerk organization context
- [ ] **Permissions System**: Dynamic permission calculation
- [ ] **Preferences**: Theme, notifications, sidebar settings with localStorage
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript interfaces

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Organization data updates when switching organizations
2. Permissions reflect actual Clerk roles (org:admin, org:member)
3. Preferences persist across sessions
4. State reducer handles all action types correctly

### 9. Global Organization State
**Features to Test:**
- [ ] **Organization Switching**: Global state coordination
- [ ] **Recent Organizations**: Cross-component state sharing
- [ ] **Route Equivalents**: Intelligent route mapping when switching
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful error states and recovery

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Switch organization from any component updates global state
2. Recent organizations list updates across all components
3. Route mapping maintains user's current workflow context

### 10. React Query Integration
**Data Management Tests:**
- [ ] **Caching**: Organization data cached appropriately
- [ ] **Mutations**: Create/update/delete operations
- [ ] **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates before server confirmation
- [ ] **Error Boundaries**: Proper error handling and user feedback

## üöÄ Performance & UX Tests

### 11. Loading States & Transitions
**Performance Features:**
- [ ] **Server-side Validation**: Layout-level organization checks
- [ ] **Loading Indicators**: All state transitions have proper loading states
- [ ] **Error Boundaries**: User-friendly error messages
- [ ] **Optimistic UI**: Fast feedback for user actions

### 12. Accessibility & Keyboard Navigation
**Accessibility Tests:**
- [ ] **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick action shortcuts work properly
- [ ] **Screen Reader**: ARIA labels and descriptions
- [ ] **Focus Management**: Proper focus flow in navigation
- [ ] **Color Contrast**: Role indicators have sufficient contrast
