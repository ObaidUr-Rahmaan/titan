Product Requirements Document: Testing Infrastructure Implementation for Titan

PROJECT OVERVIEW
Implement a comprehensive testing infrastructure for the Titan SaaS boilerplate, including unit testing with Vitest, end-to-end testing with Playwright, and continuous integration via GitHub Actions.

OBJECTIVES
1. Set up unit testing framework with Vitest for component and utility testing
2. Configure end-to-end testing with Playwright for critical user flows
3. Implement GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing on pull requests
4. Ensure security best practices for handling environment variables in CI/CD
5. Provide clear documentation and examples for future test development

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

Testing Frameworks:
- Vitest for unit testing (Next.js compatible, TypeScript support)
- Playwright for E2E testing (cross-browser support)
- Testing Library for React component testing
- Coverage reporting with @vitest/coverage-v8

CI/CD Requirements:
- GitHub Actions workflow triggered on pull requests
- Biome formatter and linter checks
- Unit test execution with coverage reporting
- E2E test execution across multiple browsers
- TypeScript type checking
- Build verification
- Secure handling of environment variables

Security Requirements:
- No hardcoded credentials in version control
- Use of .env.test.example for safe defaults
- GitHub Secrets integration for sensitive test data
- Proper mocking of external services in tests

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

1. Package Dependencies:
   - Add testing libraries to devDependencies
   - Configure test scripts in package.json
   - Ensure compatibility with existing Bun package manager

2. Configuration Files:
   - vitest.config.ts with Next.js compatibility
   - playwright.config.ts with browser configurations
   - Test setup files for global mocks and utilities

3. Test Structure:
   - Unit tests in __tests__ directories next to components
   - E2E tests in /e2e directory at project root
   - Test utilities and helpers in /test directory

4. Example Tests:
   - Button component unit test
   - Utility function test (cn function)
   - Homepage E2E test
   - Authentication flow E2E test

5. GitHub Actions Workflow:
   - Separate jobs for different test types
   - Dependency caching for performance
   - Artifact uploads for test results
   - Proper environment variable handling

6. Documentation:
   - Testing guide in test/README.md
   - Security documentation for credential management
   - Best practices and troubleshooting guide

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
1. All test commands run successfully locally
2. GitHub Actions workflow passes on pull requests
3. Test coverage reports are generated and accessible
4. No security vulnerabilities from exposed credentials
5. Clear documentation for adding new tests
6. Example tests demonstrate best practices

DELIVERABLES
1. Updated package.json with test dependencies and scripts
2. Vitest configuration file
3. Playwright configuration file
4. Test setup and utility files
5. Example unit and E2E tests
6. GitHub Actions workflow file
7. Security-focused environment configuration
8. Comprehensive testing documentation

SUCCESS METRICS
- Zero failing tests in initial implementation
- 80%+ code coverage on example components
- Sub-5 minute CI/CD pipeline execution
- No exposed credentials in version control
- Easy onboarding for developers to write new tests
