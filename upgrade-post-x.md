I've been silently working on some high-leverage problems for both the community and my agency that should have out-sized impact inshaAllah.

--------------------------------

For the Community (Titan):

-- The Challenge of Maintaining Titan --

1) Suppose I scaffold my own project using Titan

2) I'll work on it for a few months while improving the codebase, upgrading core packages, and adding any reusable components/scripts as I go.

But folding these improvements back into the boilerplate for others to use takes a lot of time...

--------------------------------

-- The Challenge for Developers --

1) They'll build their own projects off of Titan

2) They'll work on them for a while, adding their own features and components specific to their idea.

3) Meanwhile, Titan itself keeps improving (better components, workflows, bug fixes, scripts, and major updates to core features like Authentication or Payments).

Pulling these latest updates into their own project can be tricky to do manually.
 
It's slow, takes time to understand compatibility issues, and overall error prone.

--------------------------------

-- Proposed Solution --

What if we had a 'Two-Way Upgrade Workflow' powered by agents?

It would let me easily push my improvements to Titan for others to benefit from.

AND

Allow any developer (at any time) to pull in any (or all) updates (bug fixes, quality-of-life improvements, core feature upgrades etc.) into their projects, while being smart enough to not break existing functionality (even if it was scaffolded months ago).


--------------------------------

(Improve the below)

For my Agency (TitanX):

Problem:

I don't have a lot of time for lengthy discussions on potential clients' business ideas or the time to research viability.

Solution:

What if I build a tool that performs deep research and validates their idea for them, and generates a comprehensive report?
